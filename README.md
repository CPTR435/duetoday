## To Run the Server
```
cd server
python server.py
```

The default url when running locally will be:
*http://localhost:8888/*
(Running on port 8888 by default)

Log files are stored in *server/etc/logs/*


## Primary things to do on the server:
1. ~~Get ASWWU authentication working~~
2. Update server/alchemy/*_models to whatever models we may want
